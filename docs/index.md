* it uses Typesafe's [Hocon](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) Configuration which is very flexible and powerful.
* its Plug N Play Architecture lets you extend and functionality with relative ease
* all tasks/modules provided by Artemisia can be independently imported as a library dependency in your application
* written using Scala. JVM which has better support for most databases via JDBC and the application can run on its own with little to no external dependencies.
