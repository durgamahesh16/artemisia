# Artemisia

Artemisia is a simple configuration driven workflow processor primarily used for data integration jobs. 

why choose Artemisia over other solutions such as Airflow.

* It is entirely configuration driven and you dont have to be a programmer to use it.
* It uses Typesafe's [Hocon](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) Configuration which is very flexible and also powerful.
* Its Plug N Play Architecture lets you extend and functionality with relative ease
* All tasks/modules provided by Artemisia can be independently imported as a library dependency in your application
* Written using Scala and JVM which has better support for most databases via JDBC and the application can run on its own with little to no external dependencies.
